# Testnet Faucet
This repo contains a faucet for testnet tokens. The faucet uses a standard merkle proof for set inclusion. In this case, we determine the set of addresses as any address that has ever deployed a contract on Goerli.

## Dev workflow
Set up the following environment variables:

Commands
- Start local node: `yarn start-local-backend`
