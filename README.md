# Testnet Faucet
This repo contains a faucet for testnet tokens. The faucet uses a standard merkle proof for set inclusion. In this case, we determine the set of addresses as any address that has ever deployed a contract on Goerli.

## Dev workflow
Set up the following environment variables:

- ALCHEMY_API_KEY (for Goerli deployment)
- DEPLOY_PK (for Goerli deployment)

Commands
- Start local node: `yarn start-local-backend`

Navigate to `localhost:3000`, potentially clear nonces on wallet for testnet.

Add the local testnets to wallet (as described in `contracts/README.md`).
